Project CoffeeShop
Speciality coffee is a coffeshop in a libary,in which i just created a website for to show you the many different options they have here. Here on the website there are recipes and when you click on them they take you to youtube page to show how to make the coffee we sale here. Also there are links to our social media websites and the hours of operation. You can also book a table if you want to come in and sit and study. As well as an online menu of products we sell.

Far as improvements, maybe actually be able create the social meida links and be able to click on them and take you to the social media pages
